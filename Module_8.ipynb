        "If you don't know, in Blackjack, the objective is to get as high as a score possible without going over 21. This game uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Cards with a number on them are worth that number. Aces can be either ones or elevens--its value is up to you. Kings, queens and jacks are worth ten. If you hold 5 or more cards and aren't over, you automatically win. Your opponent will be the computer. You will not be able to see its cards until you have decided to stop drawing that round or if you are bust (above 21). You start with 2 cards and can continue to draw more, one at a time. Again, if you're over 21, you automatically lose.\n",

        "- Start with 2 random cards and remove them from the possible cards that can be drawn. If you don't know the card types, check below. The value of your hand should be displayed \n",
        "- Input message asking if you want to draw another one\n",
        "  - If yes, then add that card's value to your score and remove it from the possible card list. Your updated card value should be displayed\n",
        "  - If no, the computer should draw its cards\n",
        "- The way in which the computer should draw its cards could be done in multiple ways:\n",
        "  - If the computer is below 21, they will always draw\n",
        "  - If the computer is below a certain threshold, like 15, then a randomiser can be used to determine if draws a card or not\n",
        "  - The likelihood of the computer drawing a card scales with the value of its current hand. For example, a hand of 10 means the computer would have a 100% of drawing a card, but a hand of 16 means the computer would have a 40% chance, and a hand of 18 means it has a 20% chance, and so on.\n",
        "  - Feel free to use your own method\n",
        "- Add checks for if you go over 21 or have a hand of 5\n",
        "- Computer's values and your values should be compared at the end to determine a winner\n",
        "- Option to choose whether an ace is equal to 1 or 11\n",
        "- Show current cards\n",
        "- (optional) Add an option for the player to play again, with everything being reset. \n",
        "  - Additionally, a score could be kept to see how many times the player has won/lost\n",
        "  - You could also bet money, by adding a money variable. You and the computer start with a certain amount and if you go down to 0, you lose.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For your reference:\n",
        "- You start with 2 cards and can decide to draw more, one at a time\n",
        "- You automatically win if you hold 5 cards\n",
        "- You automatically lose if you're above 21\n",
        "- The computer goes after you and you can't see their cards until you've settled\n",
        "- Cards 2-10 are worth their number\n",
        "- Aces can be either 1s or 11s\n",
        "- Kings, queens, and jacks are all worth 10\n",
        "- The possible cards are: Ace,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King\n",
        "- Remember there are 4 suits in a deck of cards, so there are 4 variants of everything\n"
